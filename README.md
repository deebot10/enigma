##Funtionality
I would grade my self with a Meets expectations in funtionality.
Both of my encrypt and decrypt methods are sucessfully implemented as well as the command line interface.

##OOP
I would grade my self somewhere between Above Expectations and Meets expectations. My project is broken into small steps that
I was able to turn into many helper methods. I was able to create one module that houses alot of my the working parts in my code that really helped me cut down on class size in my enigma.rb.

##Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
I would grade my self somewhere between meets expectations and below expectations, hopefully not the later. I did my best with what we've learned so far to have clean code. I might have some methods and individual lines that are to long, but I did implemnt a few hashes along the way in places I felt were logical.

##TTD
I would grade my self with meets expectations. I used TDD as I drove myself through the process testing my methods. My test coverage is above the 99%.
